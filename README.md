# CONFRONTATION:
Due to several personal issues, i had to travel a lot in the past few days. So laptop availability was really rare. I developed what i can within the limited time period. Because of that, i couldnt do everything mentioned in the requirement doc.

# WHAT I DID:
* Section 1 completely using MERN stack, no design on the front end. Just fields and buttons.
* Rest API development and integration without order entity and authentication.

# WHAT I COULDNT COMPLETELY:
* MySQL integration.

I apologize for this and the mistake is completely on my behalf. This is solely because of the unexpected situation i had to deal with it. Thanks in advance for understanding 💖.
